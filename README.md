# QMIND-2023-QKD
A simulated quantum key generation system for use with network communication. Keys will be generated by passing quantum circuit objects from user to user. The generated keys will then be interfaced with a terminal communication software similar to SSH. Functionaliality to copy files, send messages, and remotely connect to machines will all be available with encryption and identity verification being handled by generated quantum key.
