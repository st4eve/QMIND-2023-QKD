GitHub page setup | Tristan | Created github page, created issues for tasks. |
Setup Linux VM's | Duncan | Installed two Ubuntu VMs and working on setting up SSH communication between the two VMs, inspecting the packets with wireshark. Looking to disable the encryption on SSH to see each packet |
Notation | Tristan | Explained braket notation for vectors, ket is a column vector, bra is the row vector and complex conjugate of the ket. Three main gates used for creating states: X, Y, Z. To create a superposition, use H gate. Controlled gates act on multiple qubits, and will perform different actions depending on the state of one of the bits. (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate, Bloch Sphere: https://prefetch.eu/know/concept/bloch-sphere/sketch-full.png?v=1) |
IBM Quantum | Tristan | Make an account and play around with how different gates effect states: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer |
